## Flashing

[`release/initial/printsphere_full.bin`](release/initial/printsphere_full.bin) is the merged initial-flash image for empty devices.

For OTA updates, use [`release/ota/printsphere_ota.bin`](release/ota/printsphere_ota.bin).

Versioned builds are archived in the `archive/` subfolder of each release directory.

### Web Flashers

`web.esphome.io`
`https://web.esphome.io/`

- connect USB
- choose the COM port
- do not use "Prepare for first use"
- install `printsphere_full.bin` directly

`espboards.dev`
`https://www.espboards.dev/tools/program/`

- write `printsphere_full.bin` to address `0x0`

`esptool-js`
`https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/`

- write `printsphere_full.bin` to address `0x0`

The bootloader is already included in the merged image.

### Local Build / Flash

If you clone the repo and build it yourself:

```bash
idf.py -p PORT flash
```

Alternatively, write the merged image directly with `esptool`:

```bash
esptool.exe --chip esp32s3 --port PORT write_flash 0x0 release/initial/printsphere_full.bin
```

## Setup Flow

1. Flash [`printsphere_full.bin`](https://github.com/cptkirki/PrintSphere/blob/main/release/initial/printsphere_full.bin)
2. On first boot, the device starts a setup AP:
   - SSID: `PrintSphere-Setup`
   - password: `printsphere`
3. Open `http://192.168.4.1` and save your home Wi-Fi.
4. After the reboot, reopen Web Config on the device IP in your home network.
5. During provisioning, Web Config stays open without a PIN until the selected source path is ready.
6. Choose the connection mode you want to run:
   - `Cloud only`
   - `Local only`
   - `Hybrid`
7. Complete only the source path that your chosen mode requires:
   - `Cloud only`: connect Bambu Cloud
   - `Local only`: connect the local printer path
   - `Hybrid`: connect either path first; the portal unlocks setup once one path is working, and you can add the other later
8. Bambu Cloud login supports:
   - email + password
   - optional email code
   - optional 2FA code
9. The local printer path uses:
   - printer IP or hostname
   - printer serial number
   - access code
10. After provisioning is complete, Web Config on the home network uses the on-device PIN/session unlock flow.
   - hold anywhere on the display for about one second to request a six-digit PIN
   - PIN lifetime: about 2 minutes
   - unlocked browser session: about 10 minutes

Cloud and local credentials can usually be applied live from Web Config without another reboot. Changing the connection mode itself or applying a new screen rotation still restarts the device.

## Connection Modes

- `Hybrid`:
  Current default recommendation. PrintSphere tries to combine cloud and local data, picks the better active path at runtime, and still uses the local camera when available. Provisioning is considered complete once Wi-Fi is connected and either Cloud or Local is working.
- `Cloud only`:
  Cloud monitoring and cover preview only. Local MQTT and the local camera page are disabled. Provisioning is complete once Wi-Fi and Bambu Cloud are connected.
- `Local only`:
  Local MQTT monitoring and the local camera path without requiring Bambu Cloud. Provisioning is complete once Wi-Fi and the local printer path are connected. The cloud cover page is not used in this mode.

## Model Notes

- Cloud can now also carry progress, remaining time, layers, and temperatures on many models.
- In `Hybrid`, the current code prefers cloud status for `P2S` and the `H2` family.
- The current code has local status paths for:
  `A1`, `A1 Mini`, `P1P`, `P1S`, `X1`, `X1C`, `X1E`
- `P2S` local status works via V2 protocol fields (`snow`, `vir_slot`); some V1 fields may be absent or stale.
- The `H2` family requires Developer Mode for local status.
- Camera snapshots are only available on `A1`, `A1 Mini`, `P1P`, and `P1S`.
  These models expose a local JPEG snapshot endpoint that the ESP32-S3 can handle.
  Newer models (`P2S`, `H2`, `X1` series) use RTSP video streams only — the ESP32-S3 hardware lacks the memory and processing power to decode these streams. This is a hardware limitation that cannot be worked around with software changes alone.
- The code currently exposes chamber light control on supported `P1S`, `P2`, `H2`, and `X1` models.

## UI Overview

- Page 1:
  can show progress ring, lifecycle state, job name, temperatures, layers, remaining time, Wi-Fi, battery, and USB state
- Page 2:
  can show cloud cover preview and title
- Page 3:
  can show local camera snapshots when that path is working
- Long-press on the display:
  requests a Web Config PIN
- Tap on the camera page:
  requests a refresh of the current image
- Tap the center logo on page 1 on supported printers:
  requests a chamber light toggle
- Dynamic secondary text such as IP addresses, project titles, and portal hints uses a more complete font for better glyph coverage

## Web Config

Web Config currently exposes sections for:

- `Step 1 - Wi-Fi`
- `Connection Mode`
- `Step 2 - Bambu Cloud`
- `Step 3 - Local Printer Path`
- `Screen Rotation`
- `Arc Colors`

During initial provisioning, Web Config stays open until the selected source mode has at least one working path. After that, the portal uses the on-device PIN/session unlock flow on the home network.

Arc colors are intended to preview live immediately and can be saved without restarting the device. Screen rotation uses the display controller's hardware rotation and applies on restart so touch stays aligned.

## Current Limitations

- **Camera snapshots are limited to `A1`, `A1 Mini`, `P1P`, `P1S` due to ESP32-S3 hardware constraints.** Newer models only offer RTSP streams which the ESP32-S3 cannot decode.
- cloud/local behavior on newer families still needs broader real-world validation
- `P2S` local status uses V2 protocol; some legacy fields may behave differently than on older printers
- `H2` local status requires Developer Mode
- local MQTT TLS now uses an embedded Bambu CA bundle
- `Local only` works, but the broadest hands-on validation so far is still in `Hybrid` and `Cloud only`
- most hands-on testing so far has been on `P1S` and `P1P`
